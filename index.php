                Welcome! We are Cornell’s nordic (cross country) ski team. The team is very widespread in terms of both age and ability–we have freshmen through graduate students with abilities that range from being completely new to the sport to having raced at the highest level. No matter which of those categories you fit into, you can either find or create the atmosphere that you’re looking for with the ski team.  See other pages on this site for more information about what we do and how to contact us.
