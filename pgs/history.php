            The Cornell Nordic Team is researching its history in parallel with the digitization of the Cornell Daily Sun Archives. Unfortunately, perhaps the most important part of the team's history - the loss of university recognition as a varsity sport during the late '80s - has yet to be uploaded to the archives. However, the available records show the existence of club skiing and the varsity team existing as far back as the '30s. The Women's team was founded later on and those women who were interested in Nordic ski racing then were left to their own devices.

            Interestingly, the team met in the same location that they still meet today!

          In this article we can see the beginning of the end of university support for the team, "The problems are a budget of only $1500..."

            In addition to the Cornell Daily Sun Archives, the Ski Team runs a phone-a-thon annually for funding. During this phone-a-thon we reconnect with Nordic alumni and have the opportunity to learn about the past!
